                      With World War II looming, Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers introduced a bill for the creation of a women’s auxiliary force in May 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the bill and the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps(WAAC) was established. About 35,000 women applied to the less than 1000 anticipated positions because they were eager to support Army in any way possible. These women were then given jobs as clerks, typists, nurses, drivers, and cooks. However, soon enrollment rates dropped because the WAAC wasn’t considered a part of the army, so women did not receive government life insurance, overseas pay, or the same benefits as men serving on the army. Eventually, in 1943, a bill was passed that changed the association’s name to Women’s Army Corps(WAC), made it an official part of the army, and allowed women all the same rank and privileges as their male counterparts. Applicants had to pass rigorous mental tests and physical training in order to qualify for the available positions after which they were deployed to either the Army Ground Force(AGF), Army Service Forces(ASF), or the Army Air Forces(AAF). In the AGF, they worked as radio mechanics, so they were responsible for repairing and installing radios in tanks, bantams, and other vehicles. They also held the responsibility of decoding the messages they received which included essential information like the coordinates of the German army and their military strength. They also had the responsibility of training men in field artillery and teaching them how to send and receive code. If assigned to the ASF, the signal corps assigned women roles as telephone and radio operators, cryptographers, cryptanalysts, and photographic experts. Women employed in the Technical Service, processed mail, and performed clerical work for different departments. If assigned to the AAF, the women worked as weather forecasters, electric specialists, link trainer instructors, control tower specialists, or airplane mechanics.

                      Women far behind the front lines learned how crucial their work was to the victory of the Allies. Patricia Gibson helped load war vessels and vehicles with the necessary ammunition, medical supplies, and food stocks needed to carry out the mission. Several of the vessels she prepared successfully landed on the shores of the Japanese at Morotai and Leyte. Another example of a crucial soldier is Ethel Cahill who was responsible for receiving and replying requests from the field for soldiers and equipment. Her precise personnel records allowed her to promptly deploy the necessary combat forces needed which provided reinforcements to active battlefronts. Women like Gibson and Cahill provided soldiers with the proper resources and reinforcements they needed in order to successfully carry out their assault, so they also played a crucial role in the war.

                      As the Allied Forces gained land in Europe and Japan in 1944, the WAC arrived in support areas behind troops in Australia, Normandy, and China. These women helped plan D-day by relaying radio messages and helping generals construct battle plans that allowed them to smoothly close in on Germany. During this time, WAC stenographer Ruth Blaton was assigned to the G-2(Intelligence) section of SHAEF where she recorded reports from the French underground, decoded them, and replayed them to the troops planning an invasion on France. These reports included essential information like the movement and strength of the German troops occupying France and the location of bridges and railroad facilities they had sabotaged. These reports also included information on individual German officers, their shift timings, education, family, and length of service. Blanton was responsible for typing up briefing reports from this information and presenting them to the General Staff. She also helped to update the map by adding enemy and ally advancements on the war territories. Many women like Blaton contributed to the intelligence and radio transmission departments and greatly helped the allies win World War II.

                      WAC officers stayed and supported the troops until the end of the war in September 1945 when the Axis powers surrendered. Soon after, they were demobilized along with the rest of the army and they returned to America where they were bestowed many awards like the Meritorious Service Award, Army Commendation Award, Legion of Merit, Women’s Army Corps Service medal and many others. In 1948, Congress established WAC as a permanent part of the US army.  Women were needed again in the Korean conflict so many were enlisted in the WAC in 1950 and deployed to Japan and Okinawa where they replayed messages, supplies, and soldiers to battlefronts in Korea. In 1967, a WAC detachment of 90 enlisted women was also sent to help in the Vietnam war and they stayed there and supported the soldiers until 1972 when troops began to withdraw. In 1967, Congress removed restrictions on women and allowed women officers to be promoted to generals. In April 1978, the WAC branch was disbanded to fully assimilate women into all but the combat branches of the army.
