                    <h2>ANC- Army Nurse Corps</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>American women first served in the Continental Army as nurses when the American Revolution broke out in 1776.  They were chosen from the mothers and sisters of the enlisted soldiers and were sent to makeshift hospitals in tents and unused buildings. After the war, Congress disbanded this service, seeing it as only a temporary measure in a time of warfare. However, after the onset of the Civil War, more than 3000 women were recruited, many of which had little education or medical training, to stitch up wounds, and to clean and provide supplements to the soldiers. In 1898, professional women nurses and doctors were recruited in the Spanish American war during which many died from yellow fever, malaria, and other tropical diseases contracted on the battlefield. Although the patriarchal military system initially preferred male personnel, the Spanish-American war helped prove that women could be competent nurses and doctors. Therefore, Congress established the Women Army Corps(ANC) in 1901. By 1916, nurses from WAC served in multiple states like Washington DC, Texas, San Antonio, and New Mexico. When the US entered World War I, the number of recruitments rose from 403 in 1917 to 21,460 in 1918 with about 10,000 serving overseas in Britain, France, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. At the onset of the war women who applied for the corps had to be  between 25 and 35 years old, caucasian, and registered nurses with at least 2 years of hospital training. However, by the end of the war, African American nurses were also recruited,though segregation policies still applied in the ANC until 1964. ANC nurses were praised for their efforts overseas on hospital trains in France and ships in the  U-boat infested Atlantic. Many served in tents 1-2 miles behind enemy lines, with mobile surgical units that delivered soldiers to the camps on ambulances and provided emergency treatment to the critically wounded. Enduring through diseases, bombardment, and poor living conditions, the ANC nursed more than 320,000 American soldiers along with other nursing organizations. By the time they had demobilized, a third of all American nurses had served in the army. At the end of the war, 24 nurses were awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, 28 got the French Croix de Guerre, and 69 received the British Royal Red Cross, and more rewards were also given.
	    <br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
	    In 1920, Army nurses were authorized to organize themselves in ranks from Second Lieutenant to Army Major though the Surgeon General still ordered that nurses of all ranks be called ‘Miss’, thereby devaluing the endorsements. Despite all their contributions, Army nurses still received half of that of a male officer at the same rank. Therefore, they organized and lobbied Congress for full military status and were backed by line generals who had witnessed their nursing talent. Due to these political influences, they were granted full pay and allowance in the 1930s while being allowed to pursue advanced educational courses.
    <br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
	    At the start of World War II in December 1941 more than 50,000 nurses enrolled in ANC and were assigned to field, evacuation, and station hospitals. New innovations revolutionized medical services as Army nurses gained a better understanding of PTSD, blood replacement, and resuscitation. Professionals performed postoperative surgical care in developing recovery wards. Air evacuations through repaired aircraft allowed wounded soldiers to receive treatment faster. This response system was so effective that it helped Army nurses establish a record of only 5 deaths per 1000 soldiers in flight. When Corregidor fell to enemy hands in the Philippines in May 1942, 67 Army nurses became Japanese prisoners of war. They lived on starving rations and disease-infected wards while being forced to care for enemy soldiers in internment camp hospitals. During their 37 month captivity, these women suffered greatly where one nurse called Mary Bernice Brown-Menzie lost nearly 55 pounds, by the time they were released after the end of the war. Due to this encounter and the mounting death of nurses on-field teams, in mid-1943, the Army provided nurses with a 144-hour training program that introduced basic military training, organization, and sanitation. By 1944, outdoor training was increased and training aids were provided to teach nurses self-defense so that they could properly respond on the battlefield. In Anxio, January 1944, nurses dug holes outside their tents and continued to care for their patients in them, even when they were being targeted by German shellfire. In total, nurses received 1619 medals and commendations for their efforts in the war.
    <br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
	    After the war, the nurses were sent out to educate the population about communicable diseases in enemy countries that were being reorganized. In Munich, they worked to prevent a mass epidemic among the displaced people’s camp, and in Hiroshima, they tended to those wounded after the nuclear attacks. In Hamburg, medical professionals established clinics and in Germany and assisted soldiers and civilians that were experiencing psychological trauma. On April 16, 1947, the Public Law established ANC in the medical department of the Army, and officer rank was granted to ANC members with ranks Second Lieutenant to Lieutenant Colonel. Nurses in ANC  were then assigned to specialized courses in anesthesia, psychiatric, operating room, and nursing along with the required hospital administration course.
    <br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
	    In June 1950, the United States assisted Korea in the Korean War and deployed about 540 nurses there. These officers applied the new nursing practices thay they had learned as they started  blood transfusions, gave penicillin to soldiers, and sutured injuries. They monitored their supplies, ordered blood and oxygen, and used makeshift items when the equipment wasn’t available. Their effective work ethic allowed them to treat about 1500-2000 soldiers every day. From 1950 to 1960, many changes were implemented that helped establish a more sanitized and effective medical system in the ANC. The Captain’s Career course was created in the US Army Medical Field Service School which taught personnel administration, trends of nursing, and hospital organization. Color television was used to teach proper surgical procedures to Army nurses. In 1955, Public Law 294 allowed the first male nurses to be part of the ANC.
    <br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
	    From 1956 to 1975 more than 900 nurses were deployed to Vietnam to assist soldiers in the Vietnam War. Nursing care evolved to a higher sophistication and injured soldiers were evacuated 50% faster than they were in the Korean War. In fact, the demand for nurses was so high that at one point male nurses started getting drafted, and the Warrant Officer Program was implemented to support the need for nurses. These policies were unsuccessful and eventually, the Army Student Nurse Program recruited personnel, educated them, and made it mandatory for them to serve on the force in return. Eventually, more advanced training opportunities were given for specialty areas, and civilians that volunteered were allowed to pursue a Bachelor’s, Master’s, or Ph.D. in specific fields at the Army’s expense. The ANC also started assisting in the humanitarian crises as they were deployed to Iran and Yugoslavia to nurse earthquake victims, and they continued these services for refugees and other disaster-ridden places to the present.
    <br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
	    From the 1980s to the present, ANC has been involved in armed conflicts, humanitarian, and peace-keeping conflicts around the world. After the fall of the Somalian Government in 1991, ANC officers responded to the civil unrest that brewed there. In 1992,  they launched humanitarian operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Yugoslav Wars. They also accompanied the soldiers deployed to settle the unrest in Haiti in 1994. In the terrorist attack on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon in 2001, they immediately responded, treated the injured, and provided medical health services for years afterward. More than 5000 nurses were then deployed to Iraq in the Iraqi Freedom Operation that started in 2003. Since then, they have continuously been nursing soldiers in the civil wars of Afghanistan and Iraq. ANC and other nurse organizations are an undeniably essential part of military operations because they help save thousands of lives that would have otherwise been lost without them. Their accomplishments and talents also advance women’s status in society by proving that women can also courageously assist in a battlefield.

             <p>Clara Noyes served in the American Red Cross as the head of the nursing department from 1916 to her death in 1936. Delano was tasked with approving nurse enrollments, standardizing surgical dressings, and maintaining appropriate nursing equipment and supplies.  She fought to maintain the high standards of recruiting nurses as World War I wore on and required more inexperienced nurses to be sent to the battlefield. She once said “There are moments when I wonder whether we can stem the tide and control the hysterical desire on the part of thousands, literally thousands, to get into nursing … The most vital thing in the life of our profession is the protection of the use of the word nurse”. </p>

        <p>Nurse Agnes L. Swift was sent to France to work at the US Army Base Hospital 32 at Contrexeville in early 1918. There, she was assigned to the primary surgical hospital where she had to assist doctors performing eye surgeries. She was best known for her kind words and continuous encouragement to both soldiers and children injured during the war. She was then temporarily sent to base Hospital 90 to provide assistance at the overloaded hospital. When she got the opportunity, she would make batches of divinity or fudge in her ward for the patients and one man even made a cartoon(above) where he expressed his gratitude for her. She would write notes for dying servicemen who wanted to say goodbye to their families. Swift also organized a special Christmas celebration where she handed out treats and sweaters in one of the empty wards to cheer up children in the hospital, many of whom were injured and orphaned because of the war. She died on 14 July 1923 and was laid with full military honors on her 43rd birthday.</p>

      <figcaption>In 1909, Akin published this description of her nursing experience; it includes material from her letters and journals. It is noted that she emotionally expressed the toll of being the nurse more clearly in this book than in her journal and letters.  </figcaption>

        <p>In 1863, Amanda Akin journeyed to Washington D.C. to serve in the Armory Square Hospital during the Civil War. As nursing was not yet a profession, Akin arrived at the site with no medical training or experience and instead, she was expected to learn her job through experience. During this time, medical supervisors and healthcare professionals were all male and the nurses were just assigned to assist them in hospitals. The nurses were not allowed to visit field hospitals or camps which were considered unsuitable for ladies. Some of Akin's duties included giving patients their medicine and distributing the special diets assigned to certain patients. They had lunch at noon and a few hours off afterward during which they rested or went on walks. In the afternoon, they wrote letters for patients and wrote down the name, regiment, list of clothing, and other details about new patients along with the medicine they needed. In the evening, she along with the other nurses entertained the patients by singing and playing music. Often, after battles, there was an influx of new patients and Akin was horrified by the volume of patients and by the severity of their injuries. She stated in her diary “It seemed to me this evening, as I sat at my table adding to the list of medicines—writing down name, regiment, list of clothing, etc., of the new arrivals, calmly looking at the poor maimed sufferers carried by, some without limbs, on a ‘stretcher’—that I had forgotten how to feel, … it seemed as if I were entirely separated from the world I had left behind.” After about a year of service, Akin returned home to Quaker Hill.
