                    <p>During World War I, secretary Josephus Daniels recruited women into the Navy to address clerical needs so that they could free men to enter combat. 11,000 women quickly enlisted because they were eager to prove their patriotism while earning the same salary as men did at their position. They had to complete an application, interview, physical exam, and business skills test after which they took their oath and became Yeomen. During the day they decipher coded messages and worked as stenographers, switchboard operators, recruiters, look-outs, translators, and messengers. Many also worked as painters and camouflaged ships while loading the ships with the necessary ammunition and medical supplies. During the night, they learned naval procedures and policies, drilling, marching, and craft identification. They quickly become so proficient in their jobs that it was said that one of them could replace two sailors for combat duty.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>

      However, their success was not met with the optimism they expected. Their efforts helped send more husbands, brothers, and sons off to war so they were resented by the public which often questioned their character and motives. Others believed that the made the Navy less efficient or that they were government-sanctioned prostitutes for Navy officials. After World War I ended in 1918, some Congressmen expressed their opinion that another great war would not erupt and if it did, women would not be needed. They rewrote the Naval Reserve Act of 1916 to say that ‘any male citizen could join’ to reiterate that they didn’t want to include women in war efforts.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
      When World War II broke out in 1942, the War Manpower Commission reported that there was a lack of manpower again. The U.S. Representative Edith Nourse Rogers advocated that women should be reassigned to the military with the same privileges as men. She contacted the Chief of the Navy Personnel and soon the Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, established the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service(WAVES) which was led by Lieutenant Commander Mildred McAfee. Under her guidance, over 20,000 officers were educated at Smith College in Massachusetts and made officers. She also enlisted 70,000 women and oversaw their naval training. WAVES were spread across naval commands from Washington to Florida where they worked as Yeomen, aircraft mechanics, drivers, and painters. More than 30% worked as naval aviation training pilots, air traffic controllers, parachute testers, and repairers. Others also worked as chemists, weather specialists, and lawyers. One personnel called Grace Hopper invented the Mark 1 computer after being assigned to the Harvard Computation Laboratory.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
      Often, WAVES had to handle sensitive information and efficiently communicate it army leaders. Jaenn Bailey was one of the five women in the Naval Communications Annex who typed and recorded top-secret decoded messages. They were charged with delivering the messages directly to President Roosevelt; “Nobody touched that dispatch but the President” she said. Bailey and then other women personally worked on the messages and knew the content before any other official. “We knew the war was over three days before it was. We knew so many more things than the public did before it ever happened, but the President didn't” she said.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
      The WAVES were so successful in their job occupations that they were praised across the nation for their various talents and excellent work ethic. On their first anniversary, President Roosevelt stated, “In their first year, the WAVES have proved that they are capable of accepting the highest responsibility in the service of their country”. The Armed Force Integration Act of 1948 gave them a permanent place in the peacetime services. Eventually, they were dismantled in 1978 when they were integrated into the male units of the Army. Their hard work helped dispel hateful stereotypes held against women and redefined the role of women in society and in the Army by showing that they can also be tough, patriotic soldiers.

      <figcaption>WAVES Lieutenant Philpotts Grantham’s spring-summer uniform, 3rd class uniform. 1942. Taken from Hampton Roads Naval Museum.<br>The Women’s Advisory Council, established during World War II, helped design this uniform. They choose skirts over pants in order to maintain a distinction between men and women’s uniforms. One wave recalls that the uniform made things “very much easier because you didn't ever have to worry about what to wear. . . you were dressed for any occasion”. To WAVES veterans today, these uniforms are a symbol of honor and the many fond memories they made while serving their country.

      <figcaption>This poster encourages women to enroll in WAVES and it fights the stereotypes that developed during that period that women were serving men or stealing their jobs. The poster was illustrated by John Falter in 1943. It was taken from the National World War II Museum(formally known as the National D-Day Museum).

In the letter, she discusses news about her hometown and tells her mother about the tests she has to go through as part of this service. The letter was sent in June 1945. This artifact is now in the exhibit “Love, Dolly: Letters Home in World War II,” hosted by Florida State University in Chipola Center for the Arts in Marianna.
