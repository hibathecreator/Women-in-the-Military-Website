                    <br>
                    <p>On November 23, 1942, Congress approved a bill that allowed for the creation of the U.S. Coast Guard Women’s Reserve so that women could perform domestic tasks for the coast guard and allow men employees to fight overseas. Unlike the other military agencies, the Coast Guard stuck by its motto of fairness and individual consideration by promising women the same pay that men received at their positions. However, the authorities denied female officers any authority over men and they restricted women in SPARS from serving outside of the US, though they were allowed to go to Alaska and Hawaii in 1944. At first, the recruiters had a difficult time appealing women to join one of the least known military reserves, so much in fact that in 1944, the Coast Guard Headquarters at Washington D.C. ordered recruiting officers to go and appeal to prospective applicants and their families. They even started the controversial Tars and SPARS music and dance show in the summer of 1944.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
      Eventually, more than 10,000 women enrolled in the program, and they were led by commanding officer Dorothy C. Stratton, who had previously been a lieutenant in WAVES and has been credited with creating the name SPARS: Semper Paratus, Always Ready. In order to get accepted into the corps, applicants had to be between the ages of 18 and 36, be 5 feet tall, have near-perfect eyesight, and have at least completed 2 years of high school. In September 1944, the first group of 4 African American SPARS officers was recruited. Once enlisted, the women were sent to  one-month training programs at Oklahoma A&M, Hunter College, Iowa Teachers College, and later Biltmore Hotel in Florida. There, they were trained in discipline, Coast Guard history, naval terms, naval policies, and rankings, while participating in physical education, aptitude tests, physical tests, and shooting practice. "We fell into routine easily, working hard, trying to finish each day's homework and keep our rooms ship shape as well," said Yeoman First Class Margaret Gorley Foley, who trained at Stillwater. During the war, the Coast Guard trained potential women officer candidates at the Coast Guard Academy, making them the first women to attend a military academy.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
      After their training, a large portion of the women were assigned clerical work though some also worked as drivers, radio operators, or cooks. Some women worked as operators on the new LORAN technology which allowed them to calculate the precise location of ships and aircraft and was essential to planned attacks by the army. Some also worked in specialized jobs as parachute riggers, chaplain assistants, air control tower operators, nurses, and coxswains.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
      Many women appreciated the new status they had earned by being part of SPARS. One such SPARS officer was called Kathleen Stoye and she served from 1943 to 1946. She graduated from the University of California in 1937 after which she worked at the Union Oil Company in San Francisco. There, she frequently interacted with WAVES and decided to enroll in SPARS on the advice of a recruitment officer. Stoye was in the first class of SPARS officers who attended the Coast Guard Academy. Stoye said that it gave the women a great sense of purpose to be trained alongside men even though they weren’t allowed to go out to sea. After receiving her officer commission, she led her troop train to Palm  Beach, Florida where she was occasionally required to perform military duties. Then, she went to the District Coast Guard Office in New Orleans, Louisiana where she served as a morale officer. She even managed the occasional recreational activities given to SPARS and servicemen. She eventually attained the rank of lieutenant.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
      Another woman as courageous and praiseworthy as Stoye was Florence Finch. She worked as a member of Major E. Carl Engelhart's Army intelligence team in the US Army Headquarters in Washington D.C. where she met her husband, Charles Smith, a navy electrician. In December 1941, the Japanese killed her husband as they took Manila, which left Finch devastated and hungry for revenge. She convinced the American occupation forces that she would be able to distinguish her American Identity, then she enrolled for a job in the Japanese controlled Fuel Distributing Union. Because she had some Filipino ancestry, she was recruited and was responsible for writing vouchers for the distribution of fuel. While she worked there, she diverted fuel resources to the Philippine resistance that didn’t want to be controlled by the Japanese. She helped sabotage Japanese shipments, and when her boss, LTCOL Engelhart was captured, she helped him and other American prisoners of war by smuggling food and medicine to them. However, in October 1944, she was caught, imprisoned, and tortured before she was sent to Bilibid Prison. Finch was then sentenced to three years of hard labor which she performed until she was liberated by American forces on February 10, 1945, weighing only 80 pounds. Three months later, she enrolled in SPARS to “avenge the death of my husband” and was assigned to the Buffalo Harbor. When her superiors learned of her acts of bravery, the Asiatic- Pacific Campaign Ribbon. After LTCOL Engelhard was released, he explained to the media about how Finch had helped him so in 1947, she was awarded the Medal of Freedom. She died in December 2016 at 101 years old.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
      After World War II ended, SPARS were gradually demobilized until the last of the more than 10,000 enlistments left on June 30th, 1945. In 1947, SPARS was disbanded and the coast guard was returned to the Department of Treasury. In late 1949, they were allowed to rejoin work in the National Guard as part of SPARS and in 1950, many returned to active duty. In 1973, the service was dissolved as the men and women servicemen were incorporated into one service, showing that men and women are equal. Many women left contented that they had patriotically served their nation the best they could while changing the stereotypes held against women and proving that they carry their own weight, just like men.
