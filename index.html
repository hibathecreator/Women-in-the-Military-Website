                      <p>“But most of these women -- the famous and the obscure -- had one thing in common: they did not think of themselves as heroes. They followed their consciences, saw something that needed to be done, and they did it. And all of them helped win a war, even though many of them paid the ultimate price for their contribution. But their sacrifice was not in vain, especially if their courage continues to inspire others to fight injustice and evil wherever they find it."<br>
-Quoted from the book<em> Women Heroes of WWII</em> by Kathryn J. Atwood</p></div>

                  <div id='home-text'>
                      <p>Before World War I, women’s contribution to society were limited to their roles as a housewife and mother. During the American Revolution, they were merely assistant nurses with few responsibilities other than giving soldiers medicine and entertaining them, as nursing was not yet a profession. These stereotypes about women held into the 20th century where any woman that tried to do a man’s job was seen as outrageous. But as World War I dragged on and the army experienced a shortage of men to deploy, they started employing women for the positions that men held so that they could ‘free a man to fight’. Many women eagerly applied for jobs as clerks, stenographers, and secretaries even though they were given about hald the pay a man would recieve at the same position because they wanted to serve their nation at all costs. In order to provide the US army with more ammunition, many women also replaced men at weapon production factories despite the fact that they were harrased there. Tens of thousands of women joined the Women’s Land Army to become farmers and to work the fields so that male farmers could be deployed to the Army. About eight million women volunteered at the American Red Cross where some made equipment like face masks and gowns for medical professionals while others volunteered as nurses to assist doctors. By the end of the war, the Red Cross had provided nearly 20,000 nurses to the Army and NAVY that were sent to battlefields across Europe and Asia. The Red Cross also organized a motor service in which mainly women drivers provided transportation to camps and hospitals.  By the end of the war, 12,000 drivers reported having driven over 3.5 million miles. Many women also learned to be auto repair mechanics and helped fix war vehicles for the Army. American women librarians joined the effort by providing books and periodicals to servicemen. They built 36 libraries, distributed nearly 10 million books, and raised over 5 million dollars to support the war effort. Several thousand women applied to be switchboard operators for the US Army Signal Corps. These women took the same oath as soldiers and received the same pay as their male counterparts though when discharged, they received no veteran status or benefits until 1979 when the law was rectified. Around 223 women served overseas and 7 women from the entire Corps received the Distinguished Service Medal for their service. Congress also passed a bill that allowed for the creation of the Army Nurse Corps(ANC) which educated enrolled women on a variety of medical topics and deployed them to battlefronts overseas to care for soldiers on the battlefield, in hospitals, and in evacuation vehicles.

                    <p>
                      The Navy needed an increasingly higher number of ships and Navy soldiers on those ships yet they also needed someone to complete the domestic tasks like supplying ammunition and doing clerical work. Desperate for more soldiers, Josephus Daniels found a loophole in the Naval Act of 1916 which said that any citizen could be enlisted into the Navy and used it to employ women. He recruited around 11,272  eager, patriotic women who served as stenographers, clerks, radio operators, messengers, cryptographers, mechanics, ordinance workers, and performed any other domestic job for the Navy. That freed thousands of men to join the fleet and contribute to the war overseas. Then, the Navy Nurse Corps was established, and together with the Red Cross, it contributed 22,804 nurses to the war effort, some of whom lost their lives from diseases or bombardments. Thanks to the efforts of the Navy Nurse Corps, it’s chief Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee, became the first woman to be awarded the Navy Cross.
                    <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Though as quickly as these services had been established, they were soon disbanded when male soldiers returned home and found themselves unemployed. Almost all of the women who had patriotically served their country and fought against society’s critics to help in the war, returned home with no veteran status or benefits. Though people appreciated their efforts, many Congressmen and military leaders agreed that it's unlikely that women would have taken such initiative again as another world war was unlikely. They had been so revolted by the masculine jobs women had taken that Congressmen even changed the Naval Act of 1916 to say that only men could enroll in the Navy. Yet in 1939, World War II broke out, and within two years, the Army, Navy, Air force, and Coast Guard Services found themselves at a shortage of troops where more troops and more ammunition seemed to be the only way to win the nuclear war. Again, women volunteered as factory workers, nurses, clerks, mechanics, technicians, and freed thousands of men for war while receiving, on average, about 53% of what men received at the same position. Then the women’s voices were finally heard when in 1942 the National War Labor Board announced that women would receive equal pay if they fulfilled the same responsibilities as their male counterparts.

                      <p>“We have made partners of the women in this war…Shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege?”<br>

                    <p>
                      Due to the continuous lobbying of women activists and the success of women’s military associations in World War I, Congress soon established multiple military programs that were led by women. It created the Women Army Corps(WAC) in 1942, Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service(WAVES) in 1942, U.S. Coast Guard Women’s Reserve(SPAR) in 1943, and Women Airforce Service Pilots(WASP) in 1943. These women took on new responsibilities as they managed finances, loaded army vehicles, and tested parachutes; many women took on the main roles of technicians, radio operators, researchers, doctors, chemists, and pilots as they were no longer supervised by a male officer. More enlistments were educated and had previous work experience so they were given the responsibility of researching the enemies, tracking their progress through the latest technology, and often spying on their conversations. Though working conditions remained unfair, hundreds of thousands of courageous women volunteered to these organizations and others like the ANC and American Red cross because they wanted to serve their country and prove that women can be more than housewives. This time around, thousands of more women volunteered to help in the war effort and they continued to surprise the nation by performing tasks previously thought to be impossible for women. Jackie Cochran became the first woman to break the sound barrier; Grace Hopper greatly contributed to the Mark 1 and Mark 2 computers, and then she created HOBOL, the first comprehensive programming language. Others like Florence Finch proved how women could also be courageous soldiers when she penetrated Japanese camps undercover to help American POWs. Thousands of such heroes returned home without recognition, only to have their stories uncovered decades later.
                    <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After the World War II ended, women  continued lobbying for veteran status and benefits. In 1973, the WAC, WASP, WAVES, and SPAR along with other women-only organizations were disbanded and their members were incorporated into the corresponding former men-only branches. This demonstrated the idea that men and women are equal and that they shouldn’t be treated differently. In the 1980s, Congress acknowledged the sacrifices of women soldiers and granted them veteran status and benefits along with proper acknowledgment that came for decades afterward like the Presidential Medal of Freedom given to the remaining WASP veterans in 2010. Today, conditions for women in the military are much better as they train and work alongside men, are given equal pay, and are respected for their talents. Though the fight for equality isn’t over, women in the present can thank the efforts of women during World War I and II who took initiative and changed society’s perspective by proving that women are capable of doing what men can. They were often criticized for trying to act masculine or for contributing to an evil effort to separate men from their families but those perspectives changed when the women’s efforts largely benefited the country and allowed the US to prevail in both wars. Women continued to take on new frontiers as women of all races became pilots, naval officers, and even army commanders in the Vietnam War, the Korean Crisis, and in the Middle East.
